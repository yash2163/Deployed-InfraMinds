Summary of Findings:

Architecture: Hybrid Agentic System (React Frontend + FastAPI Backend + Terraform/LocalStack).
Core Flow:
Think: Analyzes intent and generates a GraphState (nodes/edges).
Plan: Validates graph against policies (e.g., no RDS in public subnets).
Deploy: Generates Terraform code using a Self-Healing Pipeline (Draft -> Critique -> Refine -> Apply -> Verify).
Visualize: Uses ReactFlow for graph rendering and "Glass Box" UI for Agent thoughts.
Key Files: agent.py (Logic), pipeline.py (Execution Loop), schemas.py (Data Models), page.tsx (UI).

Graph Lifecycle Refactor.

Achievements:

Backend Architecture: Implemented the 3-phase lifecycle (Intent -> Reasoned -> Implementation).
Semantic Stability: Intent nodes are immutable and preserved (Verified by Monotonicity Test).
Policy Enforcement: Self-correction loop applied in Reasoned phase (Verified by Idempotence Test).
Streaming & UI:
Updated agent.py to stream graph snapshots at each phase.
Updated GraphVisualizer to display these snapshots in real-time.
Added a "Evolution Phase" indicator to the UI.
