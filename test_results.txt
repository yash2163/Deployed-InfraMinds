Policy Decisions

Encryption (Policy 3)
Added property encrypted_at_rest: true
applied
Ingress Discipline (Policy 4) & Blast Radius Reduction (Policy 5)
Introduced a new load_balancer resource (public_load_balancer) to handle public ingress and front the web_server.
applied
Least Privilege / Ingress Discipline
Defined explicit ingress rules (TCP/80, TCP/443 from 0.0.0.0/0)
applied
Least Privilege
Defined explicit ingress (TCP/80 from LB SG) and egress (TCP/3306 to DB SG) rules.
applied
Least Privilege
Defined explicit ingress rules (TCP/3306 from Web SG).
applied
Blast Radius Reduction / Reliability
Added 'placed_in' edge to deploy the application tier across 'subnet_private_b' for Multi-AZ redundancy.
applied
Least Privilege / Blast Radius Reduction
Removed high-level semantic edge 'routes_traffic_to'. Flow is now explicitly defined by lb_listener and lb_target_group components.
applied
Least Privilege / Blast Radius Reduction
Removed high-level semantic edge 'connects_to'. Connectivity is now explicitly enforced by security group rules (sg_web egress to sg_db ingress).
applied
Agent Reasoning
Expansion: Materialized 11 infrastructure resources (VPC, IGW, Subnets).
Expansion: Materialized 8 infrastructure resources (VPC, IGW, Subnets).
Analysis: High-level semantic flow edges were removed to enforce Least Privilege and ensure all connectivity is explicitly defined and governed by network primitives (Listeners, Target Groups, Security Groups).
Expansion: Materialized 6 infrastructure resources (VPC, IGW, Subnets).
Estimated Cost: $340/mo
